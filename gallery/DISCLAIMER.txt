Consider this a warning.

You are about to reach uncharted territory, but before you explore, it'd be necessary to tell you a couple of things about the gallery.

The gallery is the perfect representation of not only how unserious Team Reimagination and The Bamber Team is in general, but also shows examples of the unhinged humor behind the devs.

Much of the stuff included there were mostly because of how funny they there, so expect a ton of shitposts.

That being said, there are two things needed to mention:
- The majority of content requires some context that at the moment is not supplied.
- Some stuff in this gallery may be considered a cause for concern, shock or discomfort.

If you're not willing to overlook either of these things, it's better to step back from the gallery altogether, but do keep in mind there's tons of content on there.
If you are willing, then welcome. 

Enjoy yourself and expect a wild rollercoaster.

P.P.S If you wanna explore, it's best to experience everything at your own pace. Give yourself time to comprehend everything. Check the game content folder especially, even if you have to download stuff.
